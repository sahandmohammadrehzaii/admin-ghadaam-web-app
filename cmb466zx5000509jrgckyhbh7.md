### Most sites use the query feature to search fields, but now a new feature called Acadour has been released by the Ghadaam development team. Usually, there is confusion and loss of order in the discussion of the project router and addressing on the latest component of NextJS and React projects, but with this package, the Acadour package, no data is searched and filtered in the form of a query and it refers to the depths of the server or static data. It redirects the data to the user in the form of a cancel. For more information, see the page below.
