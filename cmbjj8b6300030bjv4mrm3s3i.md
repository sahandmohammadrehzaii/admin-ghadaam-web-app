With respect, we would like to inform all our valued users that our site's login and registration system has now been updated to use GitHub accounts. This change is made to increase the level of security, ease and speed of the login and registration processes, and improve your user experience.

Advantages of the new system:

High security: Using a GitHub account means benefiting from the strong security infrastructure of this service, including two-step authentication and encryption. Therefore, your account on our site will be more protected.

Simplicity and speed: You no longer need to re-register and fill out long forms. With one click and entering your GitHub account, you can quickly log in to your account.

Integration with the developer ecosystem: If you are a developer and are familiar with the GitHub ecosystem, this system allows for direct and seamless communication with your projects and codes.

No need to create a separate password: With a GitHub account, you no longer have to worry about forgetting your password and managing multiple accounts. The login process is done with just one click and entering your GitHub account.

Multiple account support: In the future, it will be possible to connect multiple GitHub accounts and manage them more easily.

How to use: To log in to the site, simply click the "Log in with GitHub" button and log in to your GitHub account. If you do not have a GitHub account, you can register in the shortest possible time.

We hope that these changes will satisfy you and increase your productivity level. If you have any questions or need further guidance, our support team is at your service.

Thank you for your support and trust.
