### A new system called automatic detection has been launched based on your legal activities and authorized access. It has been built to establish security and enforce ethical rules. According to privacy policies, it is hoped that the percentage of activity in this section will be minimal and that one day we will consider disabling this section. This system has a very high detection power and is very sensitive to ethical issues. This robot will send you an email after identifying each violation. After 3 warnings, your account with all its features will be blocked permanently or for a short or long period of time, and the possibility of opening it early is very small
