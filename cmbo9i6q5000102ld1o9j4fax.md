### According to contracts with the Vercel hosting company, it is planned to build a new section called Marketplace, with as many as possible and with support for all free or paid platform systems depending on the user, using simpler features, the ability to communicate with free platform accounts without direct use and externally and the ability to connect it to your projects on the Ghadaam site, the first agent of which is Vercel Outage Deployment, in which a new section for Vercel deployment will be added, which will allow drag and drop to Vercel, and these features will be added later on the Vercel site directly if they meet the support of users and the network of software developers.
